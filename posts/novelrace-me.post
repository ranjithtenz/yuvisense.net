It started when [@msnarain][0] pinged me one day and asked if I could help out with a small project involving twitter. I asked how small - and he described what would later on become [http://novelrace.in][1]. It ended up being pretty small - about 150 lines of code, excluding styles and stuff. Not bad, eh?

Oh, and if you have no idea what novelrace is - [this post][2] should clear things up. And yeah, I too tried participating ([story 1][3], [story 2][4], both written late at night), but I write crap :( Maybe some other time...

**Update**: According to [this][5], the worth of 150 lines of Py code is ~4,000$! That much for a few days of coding? SERIOUSLY?
