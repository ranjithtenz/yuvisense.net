   </h3>
   <div class="entry-content">
       <p><em>I'm using a <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/home/yuvipanda/13485943/">RTM List</a> to track my milestones for this <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/gsoc-2010-the-beginning.html">my GSoC</a> this year. I'll be making a blog post for each item ticked off that list, to share what I've learnt in my journey from n00b to someone whose code is good enough to be included in GNOME. This is part 1 in the series, where I tell you about autotools</em></p>
<p>My GSoC project involves, moving major parts (UI) of Cheese to a new language - <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Vala">Vala</a>. Vala is more an extremely glorious C preprocessor than a language of its own - it just translates down to GObject based C code, rather than bytecode/objectcode. The syntax is very C#ish - I was using <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CSharpMode">csharp-mode</a> in emacs to code vala till I got bored enough to download <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Vala/Emacs">vala-mode</a>. It's got closures - haven't used them yet, here is to hoping they're real closures. It has <em>tons</em> of libraries - it takes a few (minutes|hours) to write a binding for any C library, so many bindings already exist. You don't lose speed - Vala is compiled down to C code. It also has one of Java's suckiest features - <em>Checked Exceptions</em>. The documentation is non existent - you've to pretty much read through the bindings, or the original C library's documentation to get anything done. And not many people know such a language exists (<a href="http://kausikram.net/">Kausik</a> for example - but he also didn't know you could output pdf from latex, so I don't think his opinion counts :D)</p>
<p>Cheese uses autotools for building. I had to tweak their script to make it build my Vala code as well. I've never worked with any of the autotools stuff before - I didn't even know <code>.ac</code> stood for <code>autoconf</code> and <code>.am</code> stood for automake. No big deal - Google knows it all and will tell you for free. I JFGI and found a bunch of articles about using autotools to successfully build vala projects. After reading <a href="http://www.lrde.epita.fr/~adl/autotools.html">this monstrous (180+ slides, but ~500 pages) Autotools presentation</a> (which is actually very, <em>very</em> good, btw), I had a working build script. It built my single <code>cheese.vala</code> file that did nothing but run a loop and wait to be terminated. It had a place where I could add more <code>.vala</code> files and they should (should) be included in the build. It was hackish, but like most hacks, it worked. <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/03/the-works-on-my-machine-certification-program.html">On My Machine</a>(tm). </p>
<p>Nowhere else. Turned out my script wasn't working at all - just faking it to me. I had initially tested out <code>valac</code> (the vala compiler), which had produced a <code>.c</code> file. Since <code>make</code> was supposed to produce the same file, and it wasn't stale (I hadn't touched my <code>cheese.vala</code>), it just proceeded to compiling the <code>.c</code> files with <code>gcc</code>. The Vala part of the build script wasn't being executed at all. Removing the <code>.c</code> file told me that my hackish script hadn't worked at all. </p>
<p>After banging my head for a while to figure out <em>why</em> it wasn't working, I finally landed up on the official autotools docs. Autotools had added <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/hello/manual/automake/Vala-Support.html">native vala support</a>. The hack I found was not necessary. </p>
<p><em>facepalm</em></p>
<p><strong>Moral of the Story</strong>: RTFM comes first, not JFGI.</p>
<p>Anyway, I rewrote the build script to be much more cleaner in a couple of minutes. And it worked. </p>
<p>Build systems are actually a lot of fun once you get the hang of it. A black screen with fast scrolling green text cryptic to everyone else but totally sensible to you is incredibly attractive, no? :)</p>

       <p><em>I'm using a <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/home/yuvipanda/13485943/">RTM List</a> to track my milestones for this <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/gsoc-2010-the-beginning.html">my GSoC</a> this year. I'll be making a blog post for each item ticked off that list, to share what I've learnt in my journey from n00b to someone whose code is good enough to be included in GNOME. This is part 0 in the series, where I tell you what my project is all about and how <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/cheese">Cheese</a> is going to become awesomer.</em></p>
<p>So, what exactly does <a href="http://gist.github.com/356202">my proposal</a> mean for Cheese?</p>
<ol>
<li>Moving the UI to <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Vala">Vala</a> (from C)</li>
<li>Move display bits from <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+</a> to <a href="http://clutter-project.org/">clutter</a></li>
<li>Implement Live Preview to show people how applying an effect will look before applying it</li>
<li>Implement loadable effects so you aren't stuck with just 12 preloaded effects.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm told that the scope is kinda too big for 3 months - but I'm sure that with careful planning (hah!), around 40 hours of work a week (haha!), lots of time away from college (hahaha!) I can do this stuff :)</p>
<p>I'm keeping my code in a <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/cheese">github repo</a>, so watch that for code updates. And will be updating this blog at the completion of every milestone, so subscribe if you haven't :)</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: My exams are still going on. Won't be coding much till they end (May 19th).</p>

   </h3>
   <div class="entry-content">
       <p>As part of my <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/gsoc-2010-the-beginning.html">GSoC</a> preparations, I wrote a few patches for <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/cheese">Cheese</a>. <a href="http://git.gnome.org/browse/cheese/commit/?id=fba61486adb3fb9e0172e79ffd8beeaef079ab30">One of them</a> (a one liner to fix a crash) has made it to <a href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnome.devel.announce/94">GNOME 2.30.1</a> - the other two (<a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=592081">1</a> and <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=597226">2</a>) are slightly more significant and involve UI changes, and so will be integrated later.</p>
<p>Free beer to everyone who can catch me in a bar! Free Pepsi/Sprite/Egg Puff to anyone who can catch me in the College Stores ;)</p>
<p>P.S. Obligatory thanks to <a href="http://home.cs.tum.edu/~siegel/">_ke</a> and <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/fargiolas/">fargiolas</a> for guiding me through the difficult bits :)</p>

       <p>I mentioned this in passing in my <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/hacking-more.html">earlier post</a>, and was tweeting about it quite furiously - I've been selected to work on <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/hacking-more.html">Cheese</a> for this year's <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/program/list_projects/google/gsoc2010">Google Summer of Code</a> :D </p>
<p><a href="http://gist.github.com/356202">Link to my, uhm, <em>cheesy</em> proposal</a></p>
<h3>What Now?</h3>
<p>Getting accepted doesn't mean shit. Actually finishing whatever I was supposed to within 3 months does mean <em>something</em> - especially since I've taken on quite a bit of stuff to do (Move to new language + 2 new features). I'm quite the n00b - first time I'll be doing just <em>one</em> thing over 3 months. Will be setting up a way of monitoring progress (probably via set milestones) soon enough. Will keep this place posted :)</p>
<p>Also, say Hi to my mentor <a href="http://home.cs.tum.edu/~siegel/">daniel siegel</a>. Him and fellow cheese-dev <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/fargiolas/">Flippio Argiolas</a>, who were extremely helpful in getting my proposal whipped into shape (It's a gist, so you can see how it eveolved over time). </p>
<p>The Oscar acceptance style blog post will be turned in once the three months are over and the newer, improved Cheese is accepted as good enough :D</p>
