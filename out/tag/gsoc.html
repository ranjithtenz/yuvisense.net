       <p>I used <a href="http://gist.github.com">gist</a> to publish <a href="http://gist.github.com/356202">my GSoC proposal</a>. Diffs, easy to show off, and Markdown support - made gist perfect for me to make modifications and get feedback easily.</p>
<p>It is the first 'real' document I've written - it actually had a tangible effect.</p>
<p>Now that I don't need to make any modifications, I've <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/gsoc-2010-proposal.html">moved it to my site</a>.</p>

       <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/cheese-2-31-1-released.html" rel="bookmark">Cheese 2.31.1 Released</a>
   </h3>
   <div class="entry-content">
       <p>If you had read my <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/gsoc-2010-proposal.html">Cheese GSoC proposal</a>, it would've stressed on one major point - make Cheese sexy.</p>
<p>Two days ago, one of my classmates spent 5 minutes on the bus using Cheese and trying out different effects (and poses!). Today, my brother spent 20 minutes trying to get the perfect combination of style and vagueness for his Facebook profile picture - using Cheese. He then asked me to create an account for him in Ubuntu (he was an exclusively Win7 user till then) before leaving.</p>
<p>I'm still not where I want to be (the girls haven't gone gaga over it...yet!), but I know very well that I am on the right path.</p>
<p>And a major milestone in that path is the release of Cheese 2.31.1. The 'release' means that the code is now stable enough to be actually shown off. The major features (rewrite in Vala, use Clutter, user defined Effects and most importantly, Live Previews) are in working condition. We are no longer walking through a minefield of segfaults. You can build it and show it off. When something breaks and <a href="http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/cheese/2.31/">you tell us</a>, we'll most probably not reply with 'yeah, we know that. We'll fix it when we get to it'. The road to Cheese 3.0 has begun.</p>
<p>So, what's all in this release?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Rewrite of the UI code. We removed the entire old src/ folder, and rewrote everything from scratch. Using <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Vala">Vala</a>. Why? Because ~7000 lines of C code is now ~1500 lines of Vala code. And the Vala code has more features (Live preview, for one!). The Vala compiler is pretty mature - only one 'real' bug so far (rest have been mostly binding bugs, fixed with single line of code changes). And #vala has been incredibly helpful too! And we are re-using most of the 'backend' code (Camera detection, pipeline linking, etc) - it is still in C, and writing Vala bindings was incredibly simple.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move from Gtk to Clutter for display. Means I can do stuff like overlay semi-transparent text on top of the effects. Or have animated page transitions. Or (in the future), use OpenGL effects without having to do an extra to-fro copy from memory. Have drop shadows for everything. Make the effects tilt and rotate around when hovered over. Etc, etc, etc. Clutter is the major contributor to the 'sexy' part.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User created effects. Effects are no longer hardcoded. A simple 4 line text file and enthusiasm for reading documentation is all that is required to  create your own effect. The effects are based on GStreamer, and are very flexible - you can create something as simple as monochrome + hue, or something as complex as face detection + extra limb addition to specific people :P</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Live Streaming - biggie. All effects are arranged in grids of 3x3 in multiple pages that you can swipe through. Simply clicking one will activate it pretty much instantaneously. No more 'select effect, apply, no-it-sucks, let's go back and do it again' games :) </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8768784/cheese-midterm.ogv"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8768784/cheese-midterm.png" /></a></p>
<p>I made a <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8768784/cheese-midterm.ogv">quick screencast</a> to show the new Live preview stuff to those of you too lazy to actually get the source and compile. And the subject is a pink+green teddy bear sitting on my white netbook. (And the weird stuff that turns up after I exit fullscreen is a bug in <a href="http://recordmydesktop.sourceforge.net/about.php">RecordMyDesktop</a> - and is an incentive for you to actually <a href="http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/cheese/2.31/">get the source</a> and check it out :P)</p>
<p>These are the four <em>major</em> features that are new. All the other parts of previous Cheese UI have also been implemented (preferences, thumbnail viewer, fullscreen, wide mode, device detection, etc.)</p>
<p>As for the next release - keep looking out for it, it will land soon! It will primarily be a bug fix and code cleanup release - fixing crashes, UI inconsistencies and making sure everything works as intended.</p>
<p>A lot of late night hackery (mostly because my college takes up 10 hours of 'regular' time) has gone into this release - so check it out <a href="http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/cheese/2.31/">here</a> and tell us what you think. Especially about the parts that suck. Especially useful would be if you can get someone non-technical to sit in front of Cheese, observe where all they fail (and succeed) and then report your observations back to us.</p>

<p>Cheese 2.31.1 is out. It's a dev release. Does not have zarro boogs.
But it is a release!</p>
<p>This week, we</p>
<ol>
<li>Fixed several perf bugs.</li>
<li>Fixed some weird preferences dialog bugs</li>
<li>Filed (and eventually had fixed) a bug in GStreamer.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression</li>
<li>Beautified the UI a bit (text name overlay of effects, etc)</li>
<li>Assorted administrative work to prepare for release (Copyright
updating, merging back into master, etc)</li>
</ol>
<p>I also passed my mid terms :)</p>
<p>Next week...</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove dependency on Mx Toolkit (it is not a blessed dependency,
and i'm not using large parts of it anyway)</li>
<li>Performance improvements, especially at startup time. It is taking
<em>waaay</em> too long .</li>
<li>Fix problems in video mode.</li>
<li>Make the TODO list shorter.</li>
</ol>

       <p>This week on Cheese....</p>
<ol>
<li>Performance enhancements. Sacrificed some startup time for <strong>much</strong> improved usage time. Viewing live effects are now a snap. So is selecting an effect. We went in some cases from ~15s to &lt;1s. Thanks to Tester (and other folks) at #gstreamer for helping out :)</li>
<li>Paging of effects. Effects are now in pages of 9 each, instead of a huge scroller area.</li>
<li>Applying effects without stopping the pipeline. Makes things much faster.</li>
<li>Implementing the popup menu for thumbnails.</li>
</ol>
<p>We'll be making a release anytime now :) </p>
<p>All of last week's goals were met, except the code cleanup. It will probably have to wait after release.</p>
<p>As I type this, there are 6 blockers before we can make a release. Will make a post when we do a release, hopefully with a screencast too!</p>
<p>Next week is kinda unpredictable - I'll douse fires as they arise in the code (reported by people who hopefully test the release), and also work on reducing the length of items in the TODO.</p>

       <p>Late report. But I did get quite a bit done!</p>
<p>Last week...</p>
<ol>
<li>Video Effects file format reader</li>
<li>Live Preview of Effects! (YAY!)</li>
<li>Effect files added</li>
</ol>
<p>Live Preview took most of my time. We bought down CPU usage from ~90% to a more manageable ~50%. Cleaned up code a bit (still needs more cleanup). It is rather very 'demoable', provided you gloss over the slowdowns. </p>
<p>Coming up next week would be...</p>
<ol>
<li>Even less CPU Usage! We're now even with current Cheese (which does not give you live previews). I want to bring this down even more.</li>
<li>Reduced latency for switching operations. Moving between effects/screens now has more than a second of latency. I should reduce this to much lesser than a second.</li>
<li>Code cleanup. Some of the C code is a mess - needs to be cleaned up much. </li>
<li>Error fixing. You can now crash it by looking at it at a 58 degree angle, during new moon days. Bugs like these will be fixed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Cya in a week, with a very-usable Cheese! I'll post a screencast as soon as I've made Cheese a bit more sexy :)</p>

       <p>Fourth week of the Summer of Code was over a few days back, and this report is overdue :( I've not been able to code as much as I wanted to this week - due to various non-technical issues. Will compensate in the next week.</p>
<p>Last week...</p>
<ol>
<li>Countdown Animations (Thanks to _ke for cleanup!)</li>
<li>GConf Cleanup</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, that was it. </p>
<p>Totally failed to meet last week's goals. Sigh.</p>
<p>By next week, I hope to have accomplished...</p>
<ol>
<li>Video Effects file format reader</li>
<li>Basic Effects application to the currently playing pipeline.</li>
<li>Mockups on best weay to present effects UI to user</li>

<p>Here is to hoping the coming week turns out better than last one :)</p>

   <div class="entry-content">
       <p>Third week of the Summer of Code is over! And during this week....</p>
<ol>
<li>Successfully wrapped up the core cheese functionality (<code>libcheese</code>) with a vala wrapper</li>
<li>Made Photo Mode work</li>
<li>Made Video Mode work</li>
<li>Made Burst Mode work</li>
<li>Made cheese single instance using <code>libunique</code></li>
<li>Started work on cleaning up GConf code.</li>
</ol>
<p>In <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/cheese-gsoc-report-week-2.html">last week's report</a>, I mentioned that I didn't quite like my pace of work. It is still the same (approx. 3 hours a day on average, excluding overhead) - but I've come to accept that it is okay. No more bitching about it, as long as I'm meeting my goals.</p>
<p>Last week's predictions were to complete libcheese wrapping, photo mode, video mode and burst mode. Set goals accomplished with ample time to spare - time that was spent trying to get countdown animations to work (still haven't managed), and make cheese single instance. I under-estimated last week - should improve accuracy.</p>
<p>By next week, I hope to have accomplished...</p>
<ol>
<li>Fully functional preferences dialog box</li>
<li>Countdown animations</li>
<li>Full GConf integration (i.e. remember all your preferences)</li>
<li>Full blown keybindings (Basically <code>&lt;Esc&gt;</code> to cancel, since the others are already implemented)</li>
<li>Trash/Delete implementation</li>
</ol>
<p>It would have everything Cheese 2.30.1 has, except for Effects.</p>
<p>And what did I learn this week?</p>
<ol>
<li>RTFM. Again. And again. THEN ask on IRC. </li>
<li>How to use gdb. I've only cursorily used it before - but digging into it deeper now (thank you, segfault!)</li>

       <p>Second week of the (rather hot and sweaty) Summer of Code is over! And during this week....</p>
<ol>
<li>Replicated most of the UI of Cheese</li>
<li>Learnt how to make C and Vala code co-exist (Thanks folks at #vala!)</li>
<li>Made the thumbnail widget work, in both modes/orientations</li>
<li>Implemented fullscreen mode, with autohiding of the action buttons</li>
<li>Started modifying parts of libcheese to support clutter for video output</li>
</ol>
<p>In <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/cheese-gsoc-report-week-1.html">last week's report</a>, I mentioned that I didn't quite like my pace of work. I <em>still</em> don't like it - <a href="http://projecthamster.wordpress.com/">Hamster</a> reports I've spent 15.2 hours since Monday on Cheese, which is just about 3 hours a day! Totally unacceptable, and I'd like to increase that number considerably. </p>
<p>Last week's predictions were for libcheese integration, UI replication and Thumbnail view implementation. I've finished the last two, and have made a start on the first. Needs improvement.</p>
<p>By next week, I hope to have accomplished...</p>
<ol>
<li>Working video preview showing up!</li>
<li>Photo taking works</li>
<li>Video taking works</li>
<li>Burst mode works</li>
</ol>
<p>Basically, it would be usable. In a basic way.</p>
<p>And what did I learn this week?</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't try to be too clever. Clear Code &gt; Lesser LoC.</li>
<li>Ask first. Verify assumptions.</li>
<li>Just because something can be rewritten, does not mean it should be :)</li>
</ol>
<p>On an unrelated note, my sleep cycle is totally messed up - I've been sleeping at 6 AM and waking up at 2 PM. Sunlight feels weird to me. I haven't been able to do my biweekly bicycle rides :( I should also try to fix that before the end of next week.</p>

   <div class="entry-content">
       <p>First week of official coding is over. What do I have to show for it?</p>
<ol>
<li>Moved code from Github to GNOME Git (Thanks fargiolas!)</li>
<li>Learnt how to use GTKBuilder, and how to autoconnect signals to vala callback functions.</li>
<li>Learnt <em>some</em> of the intricacies of Gtk+ Layouts (They still have a lot to teach me!)</li>
<li>Got a very basic version of the basic Cheese window up and running.</li>
<li>Learnt how to embed Clutter into the Gtk+ base of Cheese.</li>
</ol>
<p>So far so good. I don't quite like the pace of my work - I should be going faster. Hopefully I won't be feeling like this at the end of next week :)</p>
<p>By next week, I hope to have accomplished...</p>
<ol>
<li>Pixel perfect UI, replicating exactly what is in cheese right now (except for the viewport, ofcourse)</li>
<li>Vala bindings (<code>.vapi</code> files, basically) for <code>libcheese</code></li>
<li>Thumbnail View finished (either wrap and use current code, steal some some other project or write my own)</li>
<li>Basic work on modifying libcheese to support video output to a ClutterTexture</li>
</ol>
<p>GSoC is primarily about learning, so what have I learnt so far?</p>
<ol>
<li><code>git</code> is a powerful tool, provided you do not fight it (thanks fargiolas!)</li>
<li>Just because code works, doesn't mean it is good enough! (thanks _ke!)</li>
<li>When you are stuck, STOP AND ASK FOR DIRECTIONS! (thanks fargiolas!)</li>
</ol>

   </h3>
   <div class="entry-content">
       <p><strong>Note</strong>: I'm not an expert on Vala, GTK+, or anything else for that matter. If I am off base someplace, comment.</p>
<p>I spent quite a some time today trying to get GTKBuilder to automagically connect all my signals to their handlers. I tripped up at a few places, and so recording them here for posterity.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you are using instance methods (like most of us are), you've to decorate your handler function with the attribute <code>[CCode (instance_pos=-1)]</code>. This makes sure that the function is passed the <code>this</code> pointer as last argument, rather than first. You've to do this because <code>Builder.connect_signals</code> passes the instance as last parameter (<code>user_data</code>), and by aligning your <code>this</code> pointer with <code>user_data</code>, you make sure the correct instance is called.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure your handler function signature matches what is expected. Ignore the <code>user_data</code> parameter of most signals - it is used internally by <code>Builder.connect_signals</code> (see above point).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure you pass <code>--pkg gmodule-2.0</code> to your <code>valac</code>. If you're using Autotools, this means you pass it to <code>VALAFLAGS</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sure your C compiler is called with <code>-dynamic-export</code>. I'm told this enabled support for <code>dlopen</code> in the binary produced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mangle your names properly. <code>Cheese.MainWindow.on_quit()</code> becomes <code>cheese_main_window_on_quit</code> on C, and that is what GTKBuilder expects. If you are not sure how your function name is mangled by <code>valac</code>, checkout the generated <code>.c</code> file.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you do all these 5 things right and you're still having trouble, turn up on #vala at irc.gimp.net and ask the helpful folks there :)</p>

   </h3>
   <div class="entry-content">
       <p><em>I'm using a <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/home/yuvipanda/13485943/">RTM List</a> to track my milestones for this <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/gsoc-2010-the-beginning.html">my GSoC</a> this year. I'll be making a blog post for each item ticked off that list, to share what I've learnt in my journey from n00b to someone whose code is good enough to be included in GNOME. This is part 1 in the series, where I tell you about autotools</em></p>
<p>My GSoC project involves, moving major parts (UI) of Cheese to a new language - <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Vala">Vala</a>. Vala is more an extremely glorious C preprocessor than a language of its own - it just translates down to GObject based C code, rather than bytecode/objectcode. The syntax is very C#ish - I was using <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CSharpMode">csharp-mode</a> in emacs to code vala till I got bored enough to download <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Vala/Emacs">vala-mode</a>. It's got closures - haven't used them yet, here is to hoping they're real closures. It has <em>tons</em> of libraries - it takes a few (minutes|hours) to write a binding for any C library, so many bindings already exist. You don't lose speed - Vala is compiled down to C code. It also has one of Java's suckiest features - <em>Checked Exceptions</em>. The documentation is non existent - you've to pretty much read through the bindings, or the original C library's documentation to get anything done. And not many people know such a language exists (<a href="http://kausikram.net/">Kausik</a> for example - but he also didn't know you could output pdf from latex, so I don't think his opinion counts :D)</p>
<p>Cheese uses autotools for building. I had to tweak their script to make it build my Vala code as well. I've never worked with any of the autotools stuff before - I didn't even know <code>.ac</code> stood for <code>autoconf</code> and <code>.am</code> stood for automake. No big deal - Google knows it all and will tell you for free. I JFGI and found a bunch of articles about using autotools to successfully build vala projects. After reading <a href="http://www.lrde.epita.fr/~adl/autotools.html">this monstrous (180+ slides, but ~500 pages) Autotools presentation</a> (which is actually very, <em>very</em> good, btw), I had a working build script. It built my single <code>cheese.vala</code> file that did nothing but run a loop and wait to be terminated. It had a place where I could add more <code>.vala</code> files and they should (should) be included in the build. It was hackish, but like most hacks, it worked. <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/03/the-works-on-my-machine-certification-program.html">On My Machine</a>(tm). </p>
<p>Nowhere else. Turned out my script wasn't working at all - just faking it to me. I had initially tested out <code>valac</code> (the vala compiler), which had produced a <code>.c</code> file. Since <code>make</code> was supposed to produce the same file, and it wasn't stale (I hadn't touched my <code>cheese.vala</code>), it just proceeded to compiling the <code>.c</code> files with <code>gcc</code>. The Vala part of the build script wasn't being executed at all. Removing the <code>.c</code> file told me that my hackish script hadn't worked at all. </p>
<p>After banging my head for a while to figure out <em>why</em> it wasn't working, I finally landed up on the official autotools docs. Autotools had added <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/hello/manual/automake/Vala-Support.html">native vala support</a>. The hack I found was not necessary. </p>
<p><em>facepalm</em></p>
<p><strong>Moral of the Story</strong>: RTFM comes first, not JFGI.</p>
<p>Anyway, I rewrote the build script to be much more cleaner in a couple of minutes. And it worked. </p>
<p>Build systems are actually a lot of fun once you get the hang of it. A black screen with fast scrolling green text cryptic to everyone else but totally sensible to you is incredibly attractive, no? :)</p>

       <p><em>I'm using a <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/home/yuvipanda/13485943/">RTM List</a> to track my milestones for this <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/gsoc-2010-the-beginning.html">my GSoC</a> this year.

This is part 0 in the series, where I tell you what my project is all about and how <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/cheese">Cheese</a> is going to become awesomer.</em></p>
<p>So, what exactly does <a href="http://gist.github.com/356202">my proposal</a> mean for Cheese?</p>
<ol>
<li>Moving the UI to <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Vala">Vala</a> (from C)</li>
<li>Move display bits from <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+</a> to <a href="http://clutter-project.org/">clutter</a></li>
<li>Implement Live Preview to show people how applying an effect will look before applying it</li>
<li>Implement loadable effects so you aren't stuck with just 12 preloaded effects.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm told that the scope is kinda too big for 3 months - but I'm sure that with careful planning (hah!), around 40 hours of work a week (haha!), lots of time away from college (hahaha!) I can do this stuff :)</p>
<p>I'm keeping my code in a <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/cheese">github repo</a>, so watch that for code updates. And will be updating this blog at the completion of every milestone, so subscribe if you haven't :)</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: My exams are still going on. Won't be coding much till they end (May 19th).</p>

   </h3>
   <div class="entry-content">
       <p>As part of my <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/gsoc-2010-the-beginning.html">GSoC</a> preparations, I wrote a few patches for <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/cheese">Cheese</a>. <a href="http://git.gnome.org/browse/cheese/commit/?id=fba61486adb3fb9e0172e79ffd8beeaef079ab30">One of them</a> (a one liner to fix a crash) has made it to <a href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnome.devel.announce/94">GNOME 2.30.1</a> - the other two (<a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=592081">1</a> and <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=597226">2</a>) are slightly more significant and involve UI changes, and so will be integrated later.</p>
<p>Free beer to everyone who can catch me in a bar! Free Pepsi/Sprite/Egg Puff to anyone who can catch me in the College Stores ;)</p>
<p>P.S. Obligatory thanks to <a href="http://home.cs.tum.edu/~siegel/">_ke</a> and <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/fargiolas/">fargiolas</a> for guiding me through the difficult bits :)</p>

   <div class="entry-content">
       <p>I mentioned this in passing in my <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/hacking-more.html">earlier post</a>, and was tweeting about it quite furiously - I've been selected to work on <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/hacking-more.html">Cheese</a> for this year's <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/program/list_projects/google/gsoc2010">Google Summer of Code</a> :D </p>
<p><a href="http://gist.github.com/356202">Link to my, uhm, <em>cheesy</em> proposal</a></p>
<h3>What Now?</h3>
<p>Getting accepted doesn't mean shit. Actually finishing whatever I was supposed to within 3 months does mean <em>something</em> - especially since I've taken on quite a bit of stuff to do (Move to new language + 2 new features). I'm quite the n00b - first time I'll be doing just <em>one</em> thing over 3 months. Will be setting up a way of monitoring progress (probably via set milestones) soon enough. Will keep this place posted :)</p>
<p>Also, say Hi to my mentor <a href="http://home.cs.tum.edu/~siegel/">daniel siegel</a>. Him and fellow cheese-dev <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/fargiolas/">Flippio Argiolas</a>, who were extremely helpful in getting my proposal whipped into shape (It's a gist, so you can see how it eveolved over time). </p>
<p>The Oscar acceptance style blog post will be turned in once the three months are over and the newer, improved Cheese is accepted as good enough :D</p>
