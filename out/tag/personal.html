   </h3>
   <div class="entry-content">
       <p>I, along with about a 100 other classmates of mine, went on an <em>Industrial Visit</em> to Kerala a few weeks back. It was a 3 day, 4 night affair - and was incredibly fun and refreshing. New friendships were forged, old ones rekindled, temptations resisted, a thousand pictures clicked (thanks to @RohitP's camera), group dynamics studied and incredible fun had. It was very refreshing (for the most part), and I realized just why vacations are important.</p>
<p>I plan on visiting [Athrapalli Falls][afalls] again as soon as I possibly can. Being in fast moving, (relatively) cold water is an incredibly experience I'm glad I didn't miss. You shouldn't either.</p>

   <div class="entry-content">
       <p>I mentioned this in passing in my <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/hacking-more.html">earlier post</a>, and was tweeting about it quite furiously - I've been selected to work on <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/hacking-more.html">Cheese</a> for this year's <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/program/list_projects/google/gsoc2010">Google Summer of Code</a> :D </p>
<p><a href="http://gist.github.com/356202">Link to my, uhm, <em>cheesy</em> proposal</a></p>
<h3>What Now?</h3>
<p>Getting accepted doesn't mean shit. Actually finishing whatever I was supposed to within 3 months does mean <em>something</em> - especially since I've taken on quite a bit of stuff to do (Move to new language + 2 new features). I'm quite the n00b - first time I'll be doing just <em>one</em> thing over 3 months. Will be setting up a way of monitoring progress (probably via set milestones) soon enough. Will keep this place posted :)</p>
<p>Also, say Hi to my mentor <a href="http://home.cs.tum.edu/~siegel/">daniel siegel</a>. Him and fellow cheese-dev <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/fargiolas/">Flippio Argiolas</a>, who were extremely helpful in getting my proposal whipped into shape (It's a gist, so you can see how it eveolved over time). </p>
<p>The Oscar acceptance style blog post will be turned in once the three months are over and the newer, improved Cheese is accepted as good enough :D</p>

   <div class="entry-content">
       <p>Quoting from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Levy">Steven Levy</a>'s <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/729">Hackers</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[..] a project undertaken or a product built not solely to fulfill
some constructive goal, but with some wild pleasure taken in mere
involvement, was called a "hack."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Building things for the fun of building them is hacking. And <a href="http://db.glug-bom.org/lug-authors/philip/docs/hackers-not-crackers.html">hacking is not illegally breaking into computers</a>. </p>
<p>I like hacking. I want to be a real hacker. I can't call myself one yet.</p>
<p>I'm putting this up as a reminder to myself - about what is important and what isn't. Here is to hoping I remember to say <em>No</em> more often. Here is to hoping that the next time I'm bored, I write something rather than idle on IRC. GSoC (a bigger post about it coming up) is helping - a lot. </p>
<p>I'll do a monthly 'things I've hacked on' post, and see how many things turn up on that :)</p>

   <div class="entry-content">
       <p>Wake up at 10. Roll around bed for half an hour. Chase brother away from <em>your</em> computer (on which he was playing GTA (or NFS)). Check mail. Find something to code on, code. Check mail. Check <a href="http://programming.reddit.com">proggit</a>. Check <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">HN</a>. Waste some time on <a href="http://twitter.com/yuvipanda">Twitter</a>. Waste some more time on <a href="irc://irc.oftc.net/hackers-india">IRC</a>. Check mail. Check proggit. Check HN. Tab around, really fast. Tab around, really fast. Go have breakfast. Or lunch - doesn't matter what you call it. </p>
<p>Finish eating, watch TV a bit. Bitch about how nothing on TV is worth watching. Come back to room, chase away brother playin games again. Start codin something. Tab to Firefox to read some docs. Check mail. Check proggit. Check HN. Check Twitter. Check IRC. Check mail. Read the documentation I really opened Firefox for. Edit a bit more code. Check mail. Check proggit. Check HN. Check Twitter. Check IRC. </p>
<p>Go upstairs. Bitch about how there was nothing to eat. Grab biscuits and water. Look at the time. Look at the date. Feel <strong>Ghosh! My exams are nearing! Maybe I should start studying?!</strong>. Go back to computer. Check mail. Check proggit. Check HN. Check Twitter. Check IRC. Bitch about exams on IRC. Feel <strong>Fuck exams! Fuck marks! I don't need none of that shit!</strong>. Feel good about yorself. Check mail. Check proggit. Check twitter. Congratulate yourself on skipping HN. Go back to IRC.</p>
<p>Get on Facebook. Reply to comments. Post vague sounding status messages. Comment on pictures, randomly varying between variants of <em>Cute!</em> and <em>lol rofl look at that haha!</em>. Brag on Facebook. Check proggit. Check HN. Check Twitter. Congratulate self on skipping IRC.</p>
<p>Go back to code. Read documentation. Check mail. IM people and have philosophical discussions. Flirt around. Feel tired. Think about wasted day. Resolve to make next day better. Think about studying. Decide it is too late. Go to sleep.</p>

   </h3>
   <div class="entry-content">
       <p>I had my first ever dream in binary today.</p>
<p>The cycle moved like this:</p>
<p>Borg -&gt; nanoprobes -&gt; a scene in Minority Report when nanobots go around looking for John Anderton (Tom Cruise), who was hiding in a bathtub full of water -&gt; Will Smith and his Dog cuddling in a bathtub in I am Legend -&gt; the climax of I am Legend when Will Smith blows himself up to save the others -&gt; A column of binary numbers came up, showing state of Will Smith as 'SAD' AND <strong>MSB FLIPPED TO ZERO</strong>, and then he has this epiphany (Realization of God Moment) and becomes 'HAPPY' and the <strong>MSB FLIPS TO ONE</strong>.</p>
<p>WTF? Shouldn't he be sad when the MSB is at one (Negative) and happy when it is at zero (Positive)?</p>
<p>Note for Non-CS folks: MSB -&gt; Most Significant Bit, the left-most bit in a binary sequence. Usually, setting it to zero means the number is positive, and setting it to 1 means it is negative.</p>

   </h3>
   <div class="entry-content">
       <p>The measure of code quality is <a href="http://www.osnews.com/images/comics/wtfm.jpg">WTFs/minute</a>.</p>
<p>I just realized, after a rather intriguing facebook conversation with <a href="http://shiv.me">Shiva</a>, that the only true measure of learning is <strong>Epiphanies per Session</strong>.</p>
<p>My <a href="http://twitter.com/yuvipanda/status/7673895360">latest Epiphany</a> was a couple of days back. And the one before that was a month or so back, when I was 'pairing' with <a href="http://siddhi.blogspot.com/">Sid</a>. I think the one before that was quite some time back - when I understood the true meaning of closures. And a few "Yes, it is not just me" moments when talking with <a href="http://sriramkrishnan.com">SriramK</a>. </p>
<p>College is yet to give me a technical one. It has given me a lot of emotional ones though. Maybe someone could chuck the totally pointless part of what we call college (the supposedly technical part (where they give you xeroxes of shittily written programs that often don't compile and give you a banana if you are able to copy it perfectly on to the screen (a task at which, many <em>CS students</em> fail))) and keep just the useful parts.</p>

   </h3>
   <div class="entry-content">
       <p>I was writing a post on how 2009 ended. Here is the tl;dr version: It was my 'growing-up' year in Tech, and 'roller-coaster' year in personal stuff. There! I'm certainly significantly wiser at the end of 2009, and that is due more to my state at the beginning of 2009 than at the end :) Good enough</p>
<p>So how did I celebrate? By joining the KPP <em>competition</em> at Kurukshetra. That's what I did at around 12 on New Year's. Not intentionally, mind you. Just happened.</p>
<p>Then, on 2nd Jan, I did something interesting. On a whim, I took my bicycle, and rode an hour in traffic. Alone. To Marina Beach.</p>
<p>And then I spent the next hour sitting near the waves. Looking around. Just enjoying myself. And then rode back home, and for the first time in over 4 years, slept before 12.</p>
<p>I did it again the next day. With a friend this time. My knees were already killing me since I practically had no physical activity before this. But I still did it again. My knees would literally kill me now if they had a way to.</p>
<p>I'm happy. Teen Angst has taken a break :)</p>
<p>Let this year be the one when I remove external dependencies on my happiness :)</p>

       <p>Commitment.</p>
<p>I keep jumping around. My <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda">GitHub</a> profile is proof for that. So are the large number of projects I've taken up only to leave in the middle. Unless and until I fix my commitment issues, I'll be just-another-guy-who-learnt-to-code-in-his-teens, not the-guy-who-changed-the-world. Just reading a lot of stuff isn't going to do me <em>any</em> good unless I actually get off my ass and do something.</p>
<p>Hopefully, putting this up in public will make it more real. Maybe I'll be shamed into being more committed to whatever I choose to commit to.</p>
<p>It is good to jump ship when it is sinking, as long as you know where you want to go.</p>
