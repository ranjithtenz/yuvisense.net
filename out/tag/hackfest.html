   </h3>
   <div class="entry-content">
       <p>I was about to just type a list of stuff here, but that doesn't do the topic justice. So here I am, at 3:30 in the morning, sleep cycle screwed up by the Hackfest, typing out a post on what all I learnt from there. I spent pretty much my entire awake-time at the IIT, so it helped me a lot.</p>
<h4>Your college doesn't matter much</h4>
<p>IIT Envy. Every non-IITian has that. I spent a lot of time at IITM during the Hackfest, and while my IITEnvy did go up during the first few hours, it initially came down well below normal as I got to know the people better. What was cool about them was not <em>where they were studying</em>, but <em>what they were doing</em>. I could do what these guys were doing. Anyone can do what these guys were doing - there is nothing special about the IIT except maybe for the fact that it aggregates naturally dedicated people into pools. You don't need an IIT for that - IRC will do :)  I'm from a teeny college that nobody has heard of - that would have been a problem when people judged people by where they studied, rather than by what they did. Should not be a problem for me now :)</p>
<h4>Real C isn't hard</h4>
<p>I was utterly clueless about GTK+ when I landed up at the IIT. The first thing I told <a href="http://arun.chagantys.org/blog/">Arun</a> was that I was clueless about C and maybe would like to hack on something in C# or Python.</p>
<p>I thought I was clueless about C. All I had done was TurboC - which I had not really considered as <em>real</em> C till that point. However, an hour into the hackfest, I realized something - Pointers and Structures are all you need! Read the docs, read some good code, and you are done. I will probably do what I usually do to learn a new language - write a significant amount of useful code in it - in C very soon.</p>
<h4>Code talks</h4>
<p>I don't have any patches against my name. The only significant piece of code I think I have written so far is this blogging engine you are reading. That needs to change.</p>
<p>Doesn't mean I have to churn out code like a copier machine - I just have to have enough things to point to and be able to proudly say 'I did that'. Great Documentation, proper deployment options and a little evangelism helps too. None of my code has any of that. That has to change too.</p>
<h4>Know tools well</h4>
<p>I use Emacs. But not to its fullest potential. Same thing for pretty much all of my tools - Bash/Powershell, Build Tools, etc. Heck, I can't even write a shell script to save my life! That has to change, and change fast. I smell perl.</p>
<h4>People on IRC are friendly</h4>
<p>I've always been a lurker on IRC, just listening and not daring to speak. That changed <em>drastically</em> once I actually met these really nice people in person - so I can see my IRC usage going way up! It has also expanded my horizons quite a bit - meeting new people, getting to know people better, constantly being challenged to actually get off my ass and write some stuff, etc. </p>
<h4>TODO</h4>
<ul>
<li>Read more code. File bugs. Try to fix bugs. </li>
<li>Learn Perl. Learn C. Learn C++. Get much better at Python.</li>
<li>Go through my <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda">code</a>, document all the necessary parts, create home pages for the significant ones.</li>
<li>IRC more. I have been - the last two days have seen my IRC usage skyrocket.</li>
<li>Stop cribbing about my life and get on with it!</li>
</ul>

       <p>I'm going to participate in <a href="http://www.shaastra.org/2009/site/events/coding/hackfest">Hackfest</a> at IITM's Shaastra, starting tomorrow. Will hopefully be a lot of fun - and may I be able to contribute my first ever patch during the event ;) Got permission to not get back home - but wondering, where would I stay? Probably pass out in front of the computers :)</p>
<p>I'll be hackin on GNOME Apps - hopefully <a href="http://banshee-project.org/">Banshee</a> (since that's one app I <strong>love</strong>), or write a newish, smallish app with PyGTK. Anything would do but :)</p>
<p>Will be blogging more - Sadly, no camera, so no pictures :(</p>
<p>Anyone else coming along?</p>
