This is my second blog. My old one has been retired because, well, it's old! It contained too much ranting. It has content from me since I was 14 - a lot of that is just plain stupid, and a few are even embarassingly inaccurate &amp;amp; naive. You can still possibly checkout the &lt;a href="http://blog.yuvisense.net"&gt;old blog&lt;/a&gt; - if I manage to get the content back :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new blog will be about me. My Code. My Thoughts. My Life. My Pictures. Possibly my Stories. Ofcourse, stuff too short for this will be over at &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/yuvipanda"&gt;my twitterstream&lt;/a&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Blog Platform&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, this blog &lt;em&gt;runs&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/hislain"&gt;code&lt;/a&gt; I personally wrote. The first piece of code that I'm using in a 'production' environment. I'm pumped! There will be bugs, and I will kill them. One.By.One :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, back to work now. More blog posts hopefully coming soon!&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">/hello-world-again.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jun 2009 01:19:20 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
