&lt;p&gt;Free beer to everyone who can catch me in a bar! Free Pepsi/Sprite/Egg Puff to anyone who can catch me in the College Stores ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. Obligatory thanks to &lt;a href="http://home.cs.tum.edu/~siegel/"&gt;_ke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/fargiolas/"&gt;fargiolas&lt;/a&gt; for guiding me through the difficult bits :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">http://yuvi.in/blog/my-first-accepted-patch.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 01 May 2010 19:04:18 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>GSoC 2010 - The Beginning</title><link>http://yuvi.in/blog/gsoc-2010-the-beginning.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I mentioned this in passing in my &lt;a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/hacking-more.html"&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt;, and was tweeting about it quite furiously - I've been selected to work on &lt;a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/hacking-more.html"&gt;Cheese&lt;/a&gt; for this year's &lt;a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/program/list_projects/google/gsoc2010"&gt;Google Summer of Code&lt;/a&gt; :D &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://gist.github.com/356202"&gt;Link to my, uhm, &lt;em&gt;cheesy&lt;/em&gt; proposal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Now?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting accepted doesn't mean shit. Actually finishing whatever I was supposed to within 3 months does mean &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; - especially since I've taken on quite a bit of stuff to do (Move to new language + 2 new features). I'm quite the n00b - first time I'll be doing just &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; thing over 3 months. Will be setting up a way of monitoring progress (probably via set milestones) soon enough. Will keep this place posted :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, say Hi to my mentor &lt;a href="http://home.cs.tum.edu/~siegel/"&gt;daniel siegel&lt;/a&gt;. Him and fellow cheese-dev &lt;a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/fargiolas/"&gt;Flippio Argiolas&lt;/a&gt;, who were extremely helpful in getting my proposal whipped into shape (It's a gist, so you can see how it eveolved over time). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oscar acceptance style blog post will be turned in once the three months are over and the newer, improved Cheese is accepted as good enough :D&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">http://yuvi.in/blog/gsoc-2010-the-beginning.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 01 May 2010 18:53:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Hacking more!</title><link>http://yuvi.in/blog/hacking-more.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Quoting from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Levy"&gt;Steven Levy&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/729"&gt;Hackers&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[..] a project undertaken or a product built not solely to fulfill
some constructive goal, but with some wild pleasure taken in mere
involvement, was called a "hack."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building things for the fun of building them is hacking. And &lt;a href="http://db.glug-bom.org/lug-authors/philip/docs/hackers-not-crackers.html"&gt;hacking is not illegally breaking into computers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like hacking. I want to be a real hacker. I can't call myself one yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm putting this up as a reminder to myself - about what is important and what isn't. Here is to hoping I remember to say &lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt; more often. Here is to hoping that the next time I'm bored, I write something rather than idle on IRC. GSoC (a bigger post about it coming up) is helping - a lot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll do a monthly 'things I've hacked on' post, and see how many things turn up on that :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">http://yuvi.in/blog/hacking-more.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Apr 2010 20:08:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>How I spent the Day today</title><link>http://yuvi.in/blog/how-i-spent-the-day-today.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Wake up at 10.

Proceed at your own risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, PyCon India 2009. My first solo bit of travel outside Chennai. What fun it was :) Though it was almost 7 months ago, most of the memories are still fresh. Compare that to college, where I struggle to remember what happened last week...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it was fun. I went off by bus with the rather interesting Anirudh - a profitable startupeer and someone I met when working with &lt;a href="http://busroutes.in"&gt;Busroutes.in&lt;/a&gt;. He has a finances related degree and his startup deals with (rather cool) car electronics. He was also a KDE contributor, and is a very interesting travel partner for reasons too numerous to mention here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent some time at &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lal_Bagh"&gt;Lalbagh&lt;/a&gt;, roaming around by myself (and texting classmates with my legs hanging off a cliff-type place). Was fun! I'd definitely do that again - the place was extremely peaceful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stayed at &lt;a href="http://sudarmuthu.com"&gt;Sudar&lt;/a&gt;'s place. Staying at a bachelor's place was fun - guess that was how my room would look like if I was left all to myself. It was, however, definitely too organized for my tastes - you could actually walk without accidentally stepping on stuff ;) He's grown up too fast - he actually dragged me to a food place and forced me to have breakfast! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hung around mostly with mech-yet-wannabe-geek &lt;a href="http://kausikram.net"&gt;Kausik&lt;/a&gt; (who once famously said that he 'doesn't want to use LaTeX for resumes because most people ask for docx or pdf'), Anirudh and Sudar (who was there only for Day 1). Had a longish talk with &lt;a href="http://lawgon.livejournal.com/"&gt;Kenneth&lt;/a&gt;, who I later found out was quite a celebrity on IRC/Mailing Lists. Meeting people you knew onlyine online IRL is unsettling at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event itself went well. I was inside only for a couple of major talks - the one about waffle by &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/cnu"&gt;cnu&lt;/a&gt; is the only thing I could remember. I was mostly out in the corridors, typing out code in (one of the many) laptops that Sudar has. The lightning talks were way more fun - because they were only 15 mins or so long and packed a lot of tech (I particularly remember the one about Python internals by &lt;a href="http://artagnon.com/"&gt;artagnon&lt;/a&gt; and one about a GAE app by &lt;a href="http://blog.ideamonk.in/"&gt;ideamonk&lt;/a&gt;. I gave one too - the last one, so I had no projector, no working laptop, no mic, oh and Kausik who was supposed to present with me ditched me in the last minute :P It still went exceedingly well - it was my first time ever talking on a stage of any stage outside college and the practice I had from giving them in college (Thanks to &lt;a href="http://dorai.wordpress.com/"&gt;Dorai&lt;/a&gt; and the iCell) helped a ton. I even cracked quite a few jokes that was recieved well. Fun times - and I guess it finally killed the last remaining bits of my 'shit, you aren't really expecting me to go up there and talk, are you?' feelings developed from school days :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I left, I visited &lt;a href="http://bitterscotch.wordpress.com/"&gt;planemad&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://bangalore.nid.edu/"&gt;NID&lt;/a&gt;. Awesome place. Someday, I hope someone established a National Institude of Programming at such a scenic place, where people can come together and learn about &lt;em&gt;programming&lt;/em&gt; rather than &lt;em&gt;engineering&lt;/em&gt; (which is just college-management-speak for &lt;em&gt;IT Industry Zombie Production Factory&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you go! That's a rambling account of my PyCon India 2009 experiences. Next one is probably going to be in Chennai - looking forward to that!&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">http://yuvi.in/blog/pycon-india-2009.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Apr 2010 17:15:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Webfaction Review</title><link>http://yuvi.in/blog/webfaction-review.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I've been running &lt;a href="http://yuvi.in"&gt;yuvi.in&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://busroutes.in"&gt;busroutes.in&lt;/a&gt; on my [Webfaction][3] account for a while. I got the account for free - after Remi Delon from Webfaction noticed one of my tweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Review: I'm going to save that when my free one year plan expires, I can &lt;em&gt;upgrade&lt;/em&gt; to one of their better plans. It is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; good :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly Reccomended!&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">http://yuvi.in/blog/webfaction-review.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Mar 2010 16:45:50 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Samsung N210 Review</title><link>http://yuvi.in/blog/samsung-n210-review.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I bought a brand new Samsung N210 Netbook about two weeks back - and have been using it almost non-stop since. I've been taking it to college every day, using it at every oportunity I get - on the college bus, on MTC buses, on the train, while waiting for the train, hell even &lt;em&gt;during&lt;/em&gt; a rather very boring class!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Great&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Screen! The &lt;strong&gt;matte&lt;/strong&gt; screen is totally awesome. Viewable under all conditions - full on sunlight during a train commute or at a weird angle snuggled under the desk during class. It is sharp, and IMO has enough resolution (1024x600). The bezel is small and not very distracting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Keyboard. 94% of a full size keyboard, I'm told. It is extremely comfortable, and I don't miss too many keys. I do find the right shift absolutely useless though. The chicklet keys look great too&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Looks. One guy asked me if I was carrying a white MacBook. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Touchpad. It is large and the mouse buttons are not bad. I don't know if it supports two button finger scroll on Linux - but it does work on Windows. My hands do accidentally touch it often while typing, moving my cursor unexpectedly - but I have been able to stop that by using my right thumb for space instead of my left.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Battery. I seem to get around 8 hours of usage under varying circumstances and conditions - while nothing to laugh at, I was expecting more. Might be because I haven't been able to figure out a way to turn off the wifi chip from Linux.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Bad&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Heat. The fan isn't very noisy, but the heat buildup is appreciable. I can't really work with it directly on my lap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The inbuilt webcam. 0.3 Megapixels. Bleh!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WiFi. Drops &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; often, and not very sensitive. Ubuntu Autodetected it though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The SD Card Slot. It has a cover that comes right off, and I guarentee I'll lose it in a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many of the Function Key functions aren't supported on Linux. Was able to make the Brightness keys work after a hack though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Awful&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ugly black sticker ad for &lt;em&gt;"Phoenix Hyperspace(tm) Instant-on"&lt;/em&gt;. Ewww! Atleast there is only one big sticker spoiling this white beauty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it worth the 20k bucks I paid for it? I'm typing out this blog post while waiting at my Doctor's, so I'd say it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; well worth the 20k bucks paid :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">http://yuvi.in/blog/samsung-n210-review.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 12 Mar 2010 20:41:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>"We must take [India] as it is" - Jules Verne</title><link>http://yuvi.in/blog/-we-must-take-india-as-it-is-jules-verne.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I've gotten back to reading fiction ever since I got my netbook (review comin up!). &lt;a href="http://gutenberg.org"&gt;Project Gutenberg&lt;/a&gt; has been very helpful. Jules Verne's &lt;em&gt;Adventures of a Special Correspondent&lt;/em&gt; was the first one I completed. It is a good book - but not phenomenal. It does have a few very good moments, and one of them hit extremely close to home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards the end, when &lt;em&gt;Claudius Bombarnac&lt;/em&gt; rumbles about how the Chinese do not make full use of the engine's power - always keeping it running at 40 mph even though it could be pushed to do way more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I agree with you, but where you have a railway you might as well get
all the advantage out of it that you can."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Bah!" said Pan-Chao carelessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Speed," said I, "is a gain of time--and to gain time--"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Time does not exist in China, Monsieur Bombarnac, and it cannot exist
for a population of four hundred millions. There would not be enough
for everybody. And so we do not count by days and hours, but always by
moons and watches."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Which is more poetical than practical," I remark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Practical, Mr. Reporter? You Westerners are never without that word in
your mouth. To be practical is to be the slave of time, work, money,
business, the world, everybody else, and one's self included. I confess
that during my stay in Europe--you can ask Doctor Tio-King--I have not
been very practical, and now I return to Asia I shall be less so. I
shall let myself live, that is all, as the cloud floats in the breeze,
the straw on the stream, as the thought is borne away by the imagination."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I see," said I, "we must take China as it is."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India too, as I see it from where I am, is pretty similar. Practacality can go shoot itself in the head. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I gain by copying stuff from the board to the notebook? Nothing, but do it anyway because &lt;em&gt;that is how it has always been done&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why should I go back 10 years by not using a mobile phone? Because we aren't good enough to hold your attention long enough, so we are going to force you to not do anything else even if you are going to be bored to death (even if literally).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why should I use Turbo C, even though it is extremely antique and doesn't really conform to any standards? Because that is what the people setting the syllabus learnt! (Nothing personal, TC.exe - just that I hope people stop believing Windows was written in Java/VB because &lt;code&gt;you can do GUIs only in those!&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doesn't matter if there is a better way, if it is not the way it is done. Conservatism. Bah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm talking only from my point of view, from where I have been (apparently) hurt. I am sure this is not the only place - this happens everywhere. Anti-Change Conservatism. Which I am told, is not even the true meaning of the word &lt;code&gt;conservatism&lt;/code&gt;. I hope someone sometimes explains to me what the word was supposed to mean, and how it came to represent parents who won't let their kids out to have fun with their friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good news is, trains in China are no longer run at a max of 40 mph. Change does occur, but it takes time, and hurts those who live during it. We are those people. I hope.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">http://yuvi.in/blog/-we-must-take-india-as-it-is-jules-verne.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Mar 2010 22:20:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>First Binary Dream</title><link>http://yuvi.in/blog/first-binary-dream.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I had my first ever dream in binary today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cycle moved like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borg -&amp;gt; nanoprobes -&amp;gt; a scene in Minority Report when nanobots go around looking for John Anderton (Tom Cruise), who was hiding in a bathtub full of water -&amp;gt; Will Smith and his Dog cuddling in a bathtub in I am Legend -&amp;gt; the climax of I am Legend when Will Smith blows himself up to save the others -&amp;gt; A column of binary numbers came up, showing state of Will Smith as 'SAD' AND &lt;strong&gt;MSB FLIPPED TO ZERO&lt;/strong&gt;, and then he has this epiphany (Realization of God Moment) and becomes 'HAPPY' and the &lt;strong&gt;MSB FLIPS TO ONE&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTF? Shouldn't he be sad when the MSB is at one (Negative) and happy when it is at zero (Positive)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note for Non-CS folks: MSB -&amp;gt; Most Significant Bit, the left-most bit in a binary sequence. Usually, setting it to zero means the number is positive, and setting it to 1 means it is negative.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">http://yuvi.in/blog/first-binary-dream.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jan 2010 13:17:47 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
