So here I am, at 3:30 in the morning, sleep cycle screwed up by the Hackfest, typing out a post on what all I learnt from there. I spent pretty much my entire awake-time at the IIT, so it helped me a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Your college doesn't matter much&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IIT Envy. Every non-IITian has that. I spent a lot of time at IITM during the Hackfest, and while my IITEnvy did go up during the first few hours, it initially came down well below normal as I got to know the people better. What was cool about them was not &lt;em&gt;where they were studying&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;what they were doing&lt;/em&gt;. I could do what these guys were doing. Anyone can do what these guys were doing - there is nothing special about the IIT except maybe for the fact that it aggregates naturally dedicated people into pools. You don't need an IIT for that - IRC will do :)  I'm from a teeny college that nobody has heard of - that would have been a problem when people judged people by where they studied, rather than by what they did. Should not be a problem for me now :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Real C isn't hard&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was utterly clueless about GTK+ when I landed up at the IIT. The first thing I told &lt;a href="http://arun.chagantys.org/blog/"&gt;Arun&lt;/a&gt; was that I was clueless about C and maybe would like to hack on something in C# or Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I was clueless about C. All I had done was TurboC - which I had not really considered as &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; C till that point. However, an hour into the hackfest, I realized something - Pointers and Structures are all you need! Read the docs, read some good code, and you are done. I will probably do what I usually do to learn a new language - write a significant amount of useful code in it - in C very soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Code talks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have any patches against my name. The only significant piece of code I think I have written so far is this blogging engine you are reading. That needs to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn't mean I have to churn out code like a copier machine - I just have to have enough things to point to and be able to proudly say 'I did that'. Great Documentation, proper deployment options and a little evangelism helps too. None of my code has any of that. That has to change too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Know tools well&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use Emacs. But not to its fullest potential. Same thing for pretty much all of my tools - Bash/Powershell, Build Tools, etc. Heck, I can't even write a shell script to save my life! That has to change, and change fast. I smell perl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;People on IRC are friendly&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always been a lurker on IRC, just listening and not daring to speak. That changed &lt;em&gt;drastically&lt;/em&gt; once I actually met these really nice people in person - so I can see my IRC usage going way up! It has also expanded my horizons quite a bit - meeting new people, getting to know people better, constantly being challenged to actually get off my ass and write some stuff, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;TODO&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read more code. File bugs. Try to fix bugs. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn Perl. Learn C. Learn C++. Get much better at Python.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go through my &lt;a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda"&gt;code&lt;/a&gt;, document all the necessary parts, create home pages for the significant ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IRC more. I have been - the last two days have seen my IRC usage skyrocket.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stop cribbing about my life and get on with it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">http://yuvi.in/blog/what-i-learnt-from-the-hackfest-at-iitm.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 07 Oct 2009 23:10:41 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Hackfest '09 - Expectations</title><link>http://yuvi.in/blog/hackfest-09-expectations.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I'm going to participate in &lt;a href="http://www.shaastra.org/2009/site/events/coding/hackfest"&gt;Hackfest&lt;/a&gt; at IITM's Shaastra, starting tomorrow. Will hopefully be a lot of fun - and may I be able to contribute my first ever patch during the event ;) Got permission to not get back home - but wondering, where would I stay? Probably pass out in front of the computers :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be hackin on GNOME Apps - hopefully &lt;a href="http://banshee-project.org/"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt; (since that's one app I &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt;), or write a newish, smallish app with PyGTK. Anything would do but :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will be blogging more - Sadly, no camera, so no pictures :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone else coming along?&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">http://yuvi.in/blog/hackfest-09-expectations.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2009 01:27:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Code I've written so far</title><link>http://yuvi.in/blog/code-i-ve-written-so-far.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Code I have written so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/HiSlain"&gt;HiSlain&lt;/a&gt;: A static blog publishing system (NOT A DJANGO BLOG!). Runs this blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/wtfimb"&gt;wtfimb&lt;/a&gt;: The code that powers &lt;a href="http://busroutes.in"&gt;Busroutes.in&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/frailgrey"&gt;frailgrey&lt;/a&gt;: Markov Chain based page generator (pretty lame, actually)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/goodfather"&gt;GoodFather&lt;/a&gt;: Collection of utils for web data scraping and storing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/reappy"&gt;reappy&lt;/a&gt;: A Twitter Search Application Framework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/sadivy"&gt;SadIvy&lt;/a&gt;: A pure WSGI URL Shortener&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I've been doing a shit job of documenting them - none exists. Nor of writing tests - none exists. That should hopefully change soon :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HiSlain and reappy are where I'm going to concentrate my efforts on for the next month or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Task List for HiSlain&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refactor code, clean it up so it doesn't look like proof for the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem"&gt;Infinite Monkey Theorem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add support for raw, unmanaged pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Port a decent looking, simple theme to HiSlain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WRITE DOCUMENTATION!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write some tests, and refactor the code to make it more testable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WRITE MORE DOCUMENTATION!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Task List for reappy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a real application with it, so bugs can be fixed in the process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DOCUMENTATION!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write some tests and refactor the code to make it more testable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MORE DOCUMENTATION!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And ofcourse, new sub-pages over here for both of them (atleast). Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">http://yuvi.in/blog/code-i-ve-written-so-far.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2009 00:52:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Lessons learnt from working with the Symposium</title><link>http://yuvi.in/blog/lessons-learnt-from-working-with-the-symposium.html</link><description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Document Everything&lt;/em&gt;! On paper. Will save you from hell later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is never enough time. Start earlier than you think is early enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell people things. Make them want it. Think from their point of view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prioritize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delegate. Responsibly. And &lt;em&gt;follow up&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know when to stop. Recognize when something is good enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Printing takes a long time. &lt;em&gt;Very long timeE&lt;/em&gt;. And is boring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People often do not mean what they say. &lt;em&gt;Very often&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indoor photography requires a good camera.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Old people think in weird ways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different people prioritize differently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promises are worth shit. Usually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fight. It's worth it.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've got a mechanism to track the code accomplishments (will make that public soon), and maybe I'll write a widget for HiSlain for the blog post/day accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm liking it so far - 7 hours of code yesterday, along with 2 blog posts. Couldn't hit my code target today - but am hitting my blog target. I should figure out more ways to make this work better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's see how much I could stick to it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">http://yuvi.in/blog/3-hours-of-code-1-blog-post-per-day.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2009 00:39:22 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>PyCon 2009 - Are you coming?</title><link>http://yuvi.in/blog/pycon-2009-are-you-coming.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pycon India Logo" src="http://in.pycon.org/sitemedia/pics/logo_image.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her waitress uniform made her look cuter than ever. He knew he had to ask her out. He drummed up enough courage, went to her and said 'Hi'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She turned, gave him a cute smile, and replied 'Hello uncle, what can I do for you?'&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">http://yuvi.in/blog/premature-greying.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Aug 2009 16:02:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>AutoKrish: Because we don't get enough jilpa</title><link>http://yuvi.in/blog/autokrish-because-we-don-t-get-enough-jilpa.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I dig &lt;a href="http://krishashok.wordpress.com"&gt;KrishAshok&lt;/a&gt;'s writing.

&lt;p&gt;Only problem is, he doesn't write often. Nor does he &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/krishashok"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only solution is, ofcourse, to create a bot that &lt;a href="http://yuvisense.net/autokrish"&gt;writes like him&lt;/a&gt;, and another bot that &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/autokrish"&gt;tweets like him&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
