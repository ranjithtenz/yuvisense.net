This is my second blog. My old one has been retired because, well, it's old! It contained too much ranting. It has content from me since I was 14 - a lot of that is just plain stupid, and a few are even embarassingly inaccurate &amp;amp; naive. You can still possibly checkout the &lt;a href="http://blog.yuvisense.net"&gt;old blog&lt;/a&gt; - if I manage to get the content back :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Blog Platform&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, this blog &lt;em&gt;runs&lt;/em&gt; on code I personally wrote. The first piece of code that I'm using in a 'production' environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm calling it &lt;a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/hislain"&gt;HiSlain&lt;/a&gt;, for various reasons that might be apparent to those who need to know them. It's more &lt;a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/CityDesk/index.html"&gt;FogCreek CitiDesk&lt;/a&gt; than &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;. It is written in [Python][python], and uses [Jinja2][jinja2] for templating &amp;amp; [Markdown][mkdown] for markup. I've also ported the [tj-clean][tj] WordPress theme to HiSlain, and plan on doing more ports :) &lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">/hello-world-again.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jun 2009 01:08:46 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
