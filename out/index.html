       <p><a href="http://www.cforcoding.com/2009/06/do-programmers-optimize-life.html">Geeks Optimize Life</a>. True that. I do optimize the short route from when I get down from my college bus to my home, and me and <a href="http://sudarmuthu.com/blog">Sudar</a> did have an argument about optimization when we took the train together one day. My argument was that the distance you are going to walk is constant anyway (you either walk it at the station you are boarding the train, or where you are getting down), so moving to the extreme end of the train is pointless. He pointed out that if you walk when you are at the boarding station, you are using your <em>idle time</em> - time spent waiting for train to arrive (kinda like how the CPU can do stuff when waiting for IO to complete). However, time after you reach your destination is <em>not</em> idle time - you are not waiting for anything, so you minimizing the distance you have to walk before you can get out of the station and continue to whatever you have to do next. He was right, so I stfu :)</p>
<p>(Ofcourse, sometimes you want to actually <em>maximize</em> time spent walking - in that case, move to the wrong extreme end, and then when (and if) asked, just act confused. Works :)</p>
<p>In the comments there, <a href="http://www.cforcoding.com/2009/06/do-programmers-optimize-life.html?showComment=1245689548116#c5549841120766090734">Rich</a> says that human social interaction/norms are so ineffecient we tend to optimize them out. However, I find that more often than not, it is not that human social interactions are ineffecient - they are just difficult to quantify. Half an hour spent talking on the phone has a clear negative weightage - a loss in phone credit of 3 bucks. However, sometimes, <code>value(half_hour_phone_convo) &gt; value(30 mins) + value(3 bucks)</code>. Just that <code>value()</code> is undefined/poorly defined for inputs of type <code>conversation</code>, so sometimes we treat it as zero, and optimize it out. </p>
<p>My life has certianly been better since I stopped optimizing <code>value(conversation)</code> to zero :) Yeah, I've lost time, but I'm happier (mostly)</p>
<p>So yeah, I do optimize life. But not relationships and frendships. My life is better off this way. </p>

       <p>I'm Yuvi. This is my second blog. My old one has been retired because, well, it's old! It contained too much ranting. It has content from me since I was 14 - a lot of that is just plain stupid, and a few are even embarassingly inaccurate &amp; naive. You can still possibly checkout the <a href="http://blog.yuvisense.net">old blog</a> - if I manage to get the content back :)</p>
<p>This new blog will be about me. My Code. .NET. Python. Mono. Maybe some Linux, and perhaps Ruby. My College. Human Stupidity. Fun. My Life. My Pictures. Possibly my Stories. Ofcourse, stuff too short for this will be over at <a href="http://twitter.com/yuvipanda">my twitterstream</a> :)</p>
<h4>The Statbot</h4>
<p><a href="http://thestatbot.com">TheStatBot.com</a> is being retired. </p>
<p>I don't have enough time on my hands to maintain that seperately. I originally wanted to develop StatBot as a brand of it's own, but I now have no time on my hands to do so. I have an internship coming up (more details later), have another one slated to start in 3 months, and hell just turned down one more! And ofcourse, there is <a href="http://busroutes.in">busroutes.in</a>, <a href="http://novelrace.in">novelrace.in</a>, and a bunch of other community sites I'm involved in, along with <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda">my open source projects</a>.</p>
<p>And ofcourse, I have college life to attend to - and believe me, I'm having tons of fun. Yes, I do have a social life - I never thought I'll have one till I joined this particular college. I hope to leave the college in a better state than when I entered it, and so am taking an active interest in developing it. And the management is awesome enough to let me help. So that takes up my time too!</p>
<p>I can honestly claim to not have the time to maintain the statbot brand :(</p>
<p>However, doesn't mean I'm going to stop doing stats! I &lt;3 stats - I've just got a book from my (awesome) college library so I could start learning 'proper' statistics instead of just drawing graphs and looking for co-relations. And ofcourse, the code I use for stats (<a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/goodfather">goodfather</a>, named after my awesome friend <a href="http://lagesse.org">Rob</a>) is also being actively developed, and is in it's sixth (and possibly last) rewrite (maybe another blog post some other day about the number of rewrites). </p>
<p>Expect more stats posts. They'll be on this blog too! I promise!</p>
<h4>Blog Platform</h4>
<p>This blog <em>runs</em> on <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/hislain">code</a> I personally wrote. The first piece of code that I'm using in a 'production' environment. I'm pumped! There will be bugs, and I will kill them. One.By.One :)</p>
<p>Okay, back to work now. More blog posts hopefully coming soon!</p>
