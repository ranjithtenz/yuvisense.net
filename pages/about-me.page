Hi, I'm Yuvi and this is my personal web site. I am a second year student at an Engineering College in Chennai, and I code for fun and (sometimes) profit. I write stories when bored in class, and dabble a bit in Photography and Graphic Design. 

Python is my primary language now. But it wasn't my first - I had a long fling with .NET before this, and stil flirt around with a lot of languages and environments. My first serious apps were data collectors and web scrappers. 

I owned an awesome Canon PowerShot S3, which sadly passed away after taking ~47,000 pictures, several hours of video and quite a lot of rather rough usage. 

### Egoistical Biography
#### Written in the third person during a rather boring and dull class

Started coding at 9, writing C programs with Turbo C to 'impress' people  with his own header files, rudimentary BGI graphics and music with `sound()`, `delay()` and `nosound()`. His magnum opus at age 11 was a game of [Book Cricket][1], the source of which was sadly lost in a networking accident. 

Introduced to VB6 at 12 by a freak syllabus change, he was immediately hooked by the ease with which you can [change textbox colors][2] in a single line of code. A year of *really* horrible code followed, until the book [Hardcore Visual Basic][3] turned up in the [MSDN CDs][4] stolen from his cousin [Sudar][5]. It taught him pointers and stuff about OOP. His code still sucked.

And then the class ended.
